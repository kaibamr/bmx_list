# bmx_list

This is a simple application created for bmx riders. The user has a list of tricks along with a photo description and a video.

At this point the trick list is hard coded. In the future I want to use the database and add the ability for user to search some tricks.

## Used technologies:

- **React Native**
- **Redux**
